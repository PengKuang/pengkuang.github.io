# About the book

For courses in computer programming. Evaluating the Fundamentals of Computer Programming Languages ​​Concepts of Computer Programming Languages ​​introduces students to the fundamental concepts of computer programming languages ​​and provides them with the tools necessary to evaluate contemporary and future languages. An in-depth discussion of programming language structures, such as syntax and lexical and syntactic analysis, also prepares students to study compiler design. The Eleventh Edition maintains an up-to-date discussion on the topic with the removal of outdated languages ​​such as Ada and Fortran. The addition of relevant new topics and examples such as reflection and exception handling in Python and Ruby add to the currency of the text. Through a critical analysis of design issues of various program languages, Concepts of Computer Programming Languages ​​teaches students the essential differences between computing with specific languages.
