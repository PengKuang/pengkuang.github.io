I grew up in the rural area of Yongxing County, Chenzhou, located in the far south of Hunan Province in southern China. I have two sisters and one brother. I also have two nephews and a niece, who I love very much. My late father was a mine driller. My mum is a so-called housewife but, in my eyes, she has remarkable leadership and an entrepreneurial spirit. I had a very lovely childhood, thanks to the beauty of the countryside and the freedom to explore nature.

In my spare time, I enjoy being in nature whenever possible, dancing to stay fit, cooking for myself and loved ones, jotting down my thoughts and feelings, and creating content on social media.
