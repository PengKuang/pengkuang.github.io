I'm a WASP-affiliated Ph.D. student in Computer Science. My research focuses on the intersection of eye tracking, machine learning, and programming systems or developer tools, with influences from software engineering and design science. In addition, I'm interested in computational cognition & neuroscience, brain-machine interface, XR/VR, and quantum computing.

I grew up in the rural area of Yongxing County, Chenzhou, located in the far south of Hunan Province in southern China. I have three siblings: two older sisters and one older brother. I also have two nephews and a niece, who I love very much. My late father was a mining engineer or technician. My mum is a so-called housewife - but with remarkable leadership and an entrepreneurial spirit. I had a lovely childhood, thanks to the beauty of the countryside and the freedom to explore nature.

In my spare time, I enjoy being in nature whenever possible, dancing to stay fit, cooking for myself and loved ones, jotting down my thoughts and feelings, and creating content on social media.
