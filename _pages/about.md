I'm a WASP-affiliated Ph.D. student in Computer Science, advised by [A/Prof. Emma Söderberg](https://portal.research.lu.se/sv/persons/emma-s%C3%B6derberg), [Prof. Martin Höst](https://mau.se/personer/martin.host/), and [Dr. Diederick C. Niehorster](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/diederick-c-niehorster). My research focuses on the intersection of **eye tracking**, **machine learning**, and **programming systems** (or developer tools), with influences from software engineering and design science. In addition, I'm interested in computational cognition & neuroscience, brain-machine interface, VR/XR, and quantum computing.

I did my Master of Information Technology at The University of Melbourne where I worked as a RA for [Prof. Shanton Chang](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/3747-shanton-chang). My master thesis was supervised by [Prof. Leon Sterling](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/13376-leon-sterling) and [A/Prof. Antonette Mendoza](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6868-antonette-mendoza). Before that, I was studying at Monash University. I was awarded the International Merit Scholarship by the Falcuty of Information Technology and received my Graduate Certificate in IT there.

<!-- I grew up in the rural area of Yongxing County, Chenzhou, located in the far south of Hunan Province in southern China. I have two sisters and one brother. I also have two nephews and a niece, who I love very much. My late father was a mine driller. My mum is a so-called housewife but, in my eyes, she has remarkable leadership and an entrepreneurial spirit. I had a very lovely childhood, thanks to the beauty of the countryside and the freedom to explore nature. -->

<!-- as she was never qualified to be employed by an organization due to the lack of access to education when she was young. But, in my eyes, she is super bright and has remarkable leadership and an entrepreneurial spirit. She started her small businesses multiple times in order to financially support our family and was once quite successful as a coal dealer.  -->

<!-- In my spare time, I enjoy being in nature whenever possible, dancing to stay fit, cooking for myself and loved ones, jotting down my thoughts and feelings, and creating content on social media. -->
